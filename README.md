Sorting Algorithm work in mysterious ways! but not anymore. With this handy dandy little program, you can see exactly how sorting algorithms work, how they swap or insert or merge to finally give you the final result. The program is coded in ktinker with sorting algorithms built in that use a pre-generated list to visualize and then show each iteration of the final list. Choose your desired sorting algorithm, choose a speed, and simply press sort and watch the magic unfold.
